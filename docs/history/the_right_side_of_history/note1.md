# The Pursuit of Happiness

> Politics is about working to build the framework for the pursuit of happiness, not the achievement of it; politics helps us establish the preconditions necessary for happiness, but can't provide happiness in and of itself.

身心的愉悦，经济生活的稳定对于人生的幸福的确很重要，但并非是长久可持续的幸福。换言之，在Ben Shapiro这样的虔诚的犹太教徒而言，这些追求都“不够高级”。

### Happiness is moral purpose

> What does the Bible mean by *simcha*? It means right action in accordance with God's will.

除犹太教与基督教之外，古希腊亚里士多德也强调道德目标。亚里士多德也不将幸福视为临时的欢乐。亚里士多德首先需要定义什么是“好”(*典型的古希腊“三段论”哲学*)

>To Aristotle, "good" wasn't a subjective term, something for each of us to define for ourselves; "good" was a statement of objective fact. <u>Something was "good" if it fulfilled its purpose.</u> A good watch tells time; a good dog defends its master. What does a good human being do? Acts in accordance with right reason. <u>What makes human beings unique, says Aristotle, is our capacity to reason, and to use that reason to investigate the nature of the world and our purpose in it</u>. Act well, and in accordance with your value as a rational being, and you will be happy. We find moral purpose in cultivating our reason, and using that reason to act virtuously; pursuing moral purpose makes us "great-souled".

圣经与古希腊哲学在此处合流，共同定义出人的价值就是追求更为崇高的目标，或是去感受察觉宇宙的本质

> Bible commands us to serve God with happiness and identifies that moral purpose with happiness; Aristotle suggests that it is impossible to achieve happiness without virtue, which means acting in accordance with a moral purpose that rational human beings can discern from the nature of the universe.

### The necessity for individual moral purpose

在《汉谟拉比法典》中记载，只有国王是根据神的形象创造的，距离国王越近则拥有权利越多。但是在圣经中：

> Genesis 1:26: we are all made in God's image.

不论是国王亦或是君主还是平民，所有人在犹太-基督教义中都是上帝根据自己的形象创造的。

> The root of our relationship with other people is our relationship with the Divine Creator who endowed us with our value, and who insists that we seek Him out.

> Atomistic individualism has a tendency to drift toward self-justifying oppression of others.

原子化的个人主义倾向于自我辩护地压迫他人(*zero-sum???*)

### The necessity for individual capacity

> Finally, we must believe that we are pursuing true goals--not merely effective ones. Darwinian evolution leaves no room for the true; it only leaves room for the evolutionarily beneficial. Survival of the fittest isn't a moral principle; survival itself isn't a moral proposition. If it were beneficial to us to kill babies and eat them, that would not make it moral; if it were beneficial for us to calculate that 2+2=5, it would not make it true. But we care about both the moral and the true, and that requires a baseline assumption: that we can discover the moral and the true.

区分什么是“(道德上)正确的”和什么是“有利的”。至少在中国的传统中也有这种要求，所谓“君子不食嗟来之食”或是“身死事小，失节事大”，一个纯粹追逐局部最优解的社会的结局势必会是社会的瓦解。对于一个社会而言，人与人之间的关系是需要某种超脱世俗利益之外的东西维系的，对于犹太-基督教社会而言，"all are made in God's image"将其塑造成为一个共同体。对汉人而言，三纲五常的社会习俗与华夷秩序将汉人塑造成一个共同体。

### The necessity for communal moral purpose

> The best countries -- and the best societies -- are those where citizens are virtuous enough to sacrifice for the common good but unwilling to be forced to sacrifice for the "greater" good.

> That's dangerous stuff. It's tempting to mobilize our ardor for collective mobilization and use it as a state-wielded club to force individual virtue, or to force large-scale change. Tyranny rarely begins with jackboots; it usually begins with ardent wishes for a better future, combined with an unfailing faith in the power of mass mobilization.

> So, what does positive communal capacity look like? It looks like a governmental system capable of mobilizing to stop external threats, but unable to threaten individual liberties; it looks like a social fabric powerful enough to support community members, confident enough to avoid the tools of governmental compulsion. Few governments in human history have met that standard.
>
> Communal capacity must somehow make room for us to pursue our individual moral purposes and exercise our individual capacity while also providing us the means to work together toward communal moral goals.

### The ingredients for happiness

> We receive our notions of Divine meaning from a three-millennia-old lineage stretching back to the ancient Jews; we receive our notions of reason from a twenty-five-hundred-year-old lineage stretching back to the ancient Greeks.

从古犹太人获得的神圣性是尽可能地寻找上帝，接近上帝。(目标)；

从古希腊人获得的理性工具(*不过古希腊人是使用理性去探求the nature of the universe*)。

将二者结合一下就是，使用古希腊人的理性工具去不断接近上帝的过程就是the pursuit of happiness，对于Ben Shapiro而言，就是一种高级的幸福。
