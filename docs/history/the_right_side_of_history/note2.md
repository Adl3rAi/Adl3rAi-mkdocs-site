# 1 From the Mountaintop

> You may seek to appease the gods through sacrifices, but they're as volatile and uncaring as other human beings. Those gods have invested kings and potentates with power; you are a commoner, trying to scratch your life from the dirt. You comfort yourself with the things around you, with simple pleasures; perhaps you even find communal meaning in service to the regime. But you are essentially a cork, bobbing on the eddies of an ocean you do not control - an ocean no one truly controls.

非犹太-基督教的宗教下的生活方式，神不讲规则喜怒无常，个人的价值依附于政权。

> First, Judaism claimed that God was unified, that a master plan stood behind everything.

> Second, Judaism stated that human beings were held to particular behavioral standards for moral, not utilitarian reasons.
>
> Third, Judaism claimed that history progressed: that revelation was the beginning, but it was not the end, that man had a responsibility to pursue God and bring about a redemption of mankind.
>
> Finally, Judaism claimed that God had endowed man with choice, that men were responsible for their choices, and that our choices mattered.

## God's ordered universe

> The vast majority of religions prior to Judaism were polytheistic. That's not because polytheists were fools. It's actually because polytheism is sophisticated and natural in many ways.

> Polytheism is sophisticated in its willingness to absorb new, strange gods.

古希腊、古埃及、古罗马都是多神教系统。相反，犹太教是一神教，对于其他族群的信仰有着最低程度的容忍，或许也是犹太之后不受人待见的原因之一。

> Paganism recognizes that the universe is a chaotic place, one we can't fully understand. Pagan religious creation stories demonstrate colorfully how such beliefs manifest. The plethora of gods were created to explain a world without rules. In that way, polytheism is more pessimistic and more cynical than Judeo-Christian monotheism. Polytheism is rooted in a hardheaded belief in that which we can see. 

多神教的特点：无规则但是不抽象，可以说是十分的世俗。无规则在于多神教的体系通过创造新的神解释旧的神，不论是创世，还是各种自然现象都是神的作用，和人没有关系。不抽象在于，多神教的神圣性取决于肉眼可见的“奇观”，而此类“奇观”是给神用的，不是给人用的。

> Judaism claimed that God was now singular. Judaism claimed that God had rules - and that He abide by those rules. The universe wasn't random; the rules were generally discoverable and largely understandable. The Bible isn't a set of just-so stories designed to explain why the rain falls and the sun shines. Instead, the Bible lays forth, for the first time, an argument for the internal logic of the universe. God, according to the Bible, worked through a singular, unified system; nature operated according to a set of predictable rules from which God could stray if He so chose.

犹太教相较于多神教在于，其认为上帝是单一，且“讲理的”。不但是人要遵守规则，上帝本身也是依据这套规则创世，且上帝自身也要遵守这套规则。正因为有此类需要共同遵守的规则，人与上帝是能够对话的，也是能够争辩的。
